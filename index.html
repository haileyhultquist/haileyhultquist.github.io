        <h3>Chess AI</h3>
        <p>
          This is a Minimax based Chess AI that I wrote in Java.
          I added several Minimax optimizations (alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables, move-ordering heuristics, etc),
          an opening book generated from GM moves, and checkmating patterns for common endgames.
          It is also registered as a bot account on lichess.org, where it was adequate enough to defeat Stockfish Level 5.

        <h3>Maze Generator and Solver</h3>
        <p>
          This project generates mazes in a variety of shapes using the Aldous-Broder and Recursive Backtracking generation algorithms.
          The mazes can be solved by hand using the arrow keys, or algorithmically using Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A-Star Search.
